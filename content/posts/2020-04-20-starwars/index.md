Short answer: No.

Long answer: ...No.

I kind of missed the zeitgeist with Star Wars. I mean, I am a fan of the series, but I think I missed the boat on it being *the* big nerdy thing that claimed my life. I'm sure many people my age are just as indifferent to it, mainly due to us being children when the prequels came out. Pokemon and DragonBall Z were more our speed at the time.

But that's great, mostly because I now have no real attachment to the franchise. I don't care about Snoke's identity, or Rey's lineage, or Chewie's sexual orientation. I can enjoy the films for what they are and not have my experience hamstrung by my expectations.

So I will use this useless power to do a poorly timed and unasked for review of the new movies.

## The Force Awakens

The problem with TFA is that it's directed by JJ Abrams.

Great provocative opening to a paragraph I know, but don't get me wrong, JJ Abrams is an enormously talented filmmaker. His films are exciting, emotional and dynamic. He's the perfect blockbuster filmmaker, and the natural choice to bring Star Wars to a new generation.

Unfortunately, he's also a filmmaker that is incapable of delving beneath the surface of a story.

He's a textural storyteller, always aiming for the big blockbuster moments without really knowing how to engineer them organically.

But first, let's talk about what he succeeds at.

The tone and feel of the film is undeniably Star Wars. From the moment the film begins, with the infamous text-crawl and the pew-pews and the John Williams score, you feel like you are about to embark on an epic, Disney-approved adventure. 

The casting was perfect. Daisy Ridley shines and is believable as a formidable Jedi hero. John Boyega is likeable and energetic. I think Oscar Isaac was in it.

Adam Driver is unquestionably the star however, doing the emotional heavy lifting for the majority of the film. His Kylo Ren elevated every movie in this trilogy, and JJ deserves credit for spotting his potential for this type of role.

Overall, the best thing you can say about The Force Awakens is that you're never bored. There's always something going on to capture your attention.

Always.

The novelist Raymond Chandler once said, with regards to telling a story: "When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand". That pretty much sums up The Force Awakens. 

For example, when Han and Chewie find Rey and Finn on the Millenium Falcon, they barely have time to enjoy a cup of coffee before they're very rudely interrupted by a random space pirate gang, who then go on to serve literally no purpose to the rest of story. And there's never any build-up to these moments either. An alarm is sounded and whoops guess it's time for the next act guys!

This kind of pacing really makes the film feel uneven, as there's never time given to reflect or settle into a steady rhythm. It's action-talking-action-talking-action... 

Moving on, there was a lot of criticism directed at this film for being a rehash of A New Hope, which I don't really agree with. You could argue that the basic plot is nearly identical, with yet another Deathstar and yet another Evil Empire that wants to take over the galaxy. But the characters were new and interesting enough that I was willing to give that a pass.

The problem isn't that it's a rehash, it's more that The Force Awakens is too in love with the original trilogy.

And not a good kind of love, the acceptable, nodding courtesy you extend to an older family member. More a Brazzers stepmom kind of love. Or stepdad?

No film is made in a cultural vacuum, but this film feels like it lives in this elevated plane of self-awareness. It knows it's a Star Wars film, and it loves reminding us every couple of minutes.

## It can talk?

The language of film is not constrained to dialogue spoken by the characters. Everything you hear and see is a reflection of what the filmmaker is trying to get across to the audience, or is designed to provoke us in a very precise way. When the score suddenly becomes slow and bleak during a particuarly "emotional" scene, it's because they're trying to evoke an emotion from you. That's obvious, right?

But why that particular musical note? Why not a rolling drum solo? Why use a score at all?

Think of when Rey and Finn find the Millenium Falcon. There's a little musical sting, as if to say, "Guys! It's the thing! Get excited!"

To expand: the protagonist is confronting the antagonist in the film's climatic moment. This scene *needs* to work, as it's what the entire film has been building up to. So, the director has to make a few choices. For example, with regards to the camerawork:

Why that particular camera angle? A close, medium or long shot? Should the camera be kept static? Cutting between the actors, or having them both in frame?

Each option will have a differing tonal effect on the end product. Sad music is obviously going to make you feel sad. Energetic music will make you feel energized. A dark, soaring Zimmer-esque score in turn will also make you feel a variety of emotions.  

Long shots will orient the audience spacially.

Close ups will give the audience a strong connection to the character, as they'll be able to see intimate details on the actor's face.

![Close shot](https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/westerns-you-need-to-see-before-you-die/intro-1583359643.jpg)

There's thousands of these decisions that have to be made, and together these decisions coalesce into one singular artistic vision.

This is how the director speaks to us. And the only language JJ knows is Jawaese.

Now, there's nothing technically wrong with the direction of this film. Through all the decisions made by JJ, the film is effective at conjuring up the desired emotions when needed. But it doesn't feel organic.

When Han finally confronts Kylo Ren in what was supposed to be a huge "oh shit" moment, just pay attention to the direction. The score is muted, they're meeting in the middle of a bridge, it's dark, the dialogue sounds like people talking at a deathbed. It's just so... ominous. And obvious, and telegraphed. From the moment the scene starts you're immediately thinking "So this is when Han dies, right?"

![Death?](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-29e44ceb0b9165d0f2a52b2d26bd1cec)


Why? Why do we know this is when Han dies? Why rob us of the impact his death would have had by blunting the scene in such a way?

This is exactly what I mean when I say that JJ is unable to craft these moments organically. This is supposed to be the climatic moment of the film, the one that gives this film purpose and propels our characters forward. And yet, it falls flat. 

We're never given any insight into Han and Kylo's relationship. We never seem them interact before this moment. All the knowledge we have about them is from what we're directly told by the characters, but we're never given the opportunity to care about this relationship. So when Han dies, we're sad to see the character go, sure, but the impact it should have had on Kylo is never felt by the audience. There's no real point of connection.

But this is just emblemetic of the large issue at the film's core.

That may sound like a crazy nitpick, but do me a favour, pretend you've never seen the original trilogy and watch the film again. Like you don't know who Darth Vader is. Literally as if you were born yesterday and the last time you heard the words "I am your father" was from your actual father. 

When the film gives so much import to events like the Millenium Falcon randomly appearing or old characters showing up for the first time, wouldn't you just be thinking "What's... going on now? Why is this old man and his bear important?"

Just to clarify, obviously you've seen the old movies. Hell even if you haven't you know every character in Star Wars anyway.

The issue is, that's what this film spends the majority of its time giving importance to. It's married to the OT. It can't divorce itself from the old movies. The past, in other words. 

![Too on the nose?](https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/Kylo-Ren-and-Darth-Vader.jpg)

Was that too on the nose?

If you're thinking at this point, "Hey, wait a minute! Divorce...past...words...", that was intentional on my part. You're absolutely right, that is exactly what The Last Jedi was about! I'll get to that.

To summarize: TFA is an okay-ish movie, made with the right intentions, but lacking the forethought required to tell a cohesive story. It delights and entertains for the duration of its runtime, but doesn't do enough to stand on its own, even as a segment in a larger arc.

Luckily for us, TLJ does a lot to pick up the pieces and run its own game. But we'll get to that...

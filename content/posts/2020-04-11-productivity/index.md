## How to fight procrastination and be productive

The first half of this blog will be spent outlining a couple of helpful productivity techniques that you can hopefully incorporate into your daily life. These techniques are amazing. They're so amazing I may even try them myself some day.  

The second half will be spent psycho-analyzing myself and trying to figure out why I am the way that I am. Feel free to extrapolate and learn from my shortcomings.

Seeing as we're all trapped at home for the forseeable future, it's important that we keep ourselves busy and avoid falling into a Netflix hole for three fairytale weeks. So if you're struggling to focus and get things done, hopefully these techniques will be useful to you.

As with all things, you'll only get out of it what you put into it. So don't expect these methods to magically fix your attention span. We'll get into why that is later.  

### 1. The Pomodoro Technique

You've very likely heard of this one before. It's very simple and very, very effective, which is precisely why it's often presented as the #1 productivity technique on poorly-researched blogs like this one. 

Break your work into 30 minute chunks, with 5 minute breaks in between, and a longer break after four sessions. Write it down or use a website (important!). You can use a timer, such as [this](https://tomato-timer.com/) one, to assist you in keeping track of your sessions. I haven't checked because I'm a shitty blogger but there should be sites dedicated to Pomodoro. 

You need to be strict about it, however. Once you hear the timer, stop working or start working (within reason, of course. If something needs your urgent attention, don't say you were waiting for the timer to give you permission). 

Why does this work? It forces you to keep focus, as you are basically delegating your decision-making to the timer. There's no space for you to retreat into a state of "Oh, five more minutes of YouTube can't hurt". Since it's just five minutes, there's also no time for you to relax yourself into a coma. If you decide then to continue not working, well, then you aren't using the technqiue.

The process of scheduling a task also has an effect of clearing your mind and blanketing it from distractions. It's kind of why people do visualizations or affirmations. By writing the task or verbalizing it, you're solidifying it, making it tangible. It's something for your mind to give real estate to. 

Since each session is only ~30 minutes, you will also more readily commit to the session, instead of, say, a 4 hour marathon. It's important not to make yourself feel overwhelmed by the amount that you have to do. If your task is small and achievable, you're more likely to want to get it over and done with.

In addition, if you are studying or picking up a skill, the breaks allow for the regular assimilation of information. [Several studies](https://www.onlineschools.org/science-of-study-breaks/) have been conducted stressing the importance of study breaks on retaining information, as well as on overall mental health.

I'd also advise that you spend your breaks wisely. Don't spend it on something that will increase your stress or consume your thoughts into the next session. 

### 2. The 1% Rule

The 1 minute rule states that if it takes less than one minute to do, just do it. While this is useful for trivial things like cleaning your house, to find broad usage we'll have to extend it a bit. 

If you Google "The 1% Rule", you'll find several results circling around the principle of small, incremental results leading to big gains. I spoke a bit about it in my [first](https://mvparker.co.za/goals) post, and it is in itself another topic to discuss. The Pareto Principle in particular is a fascinating reflection of how society and nature operate.

But in this case, 1% just means the amount of effort required to kickstart your day. It's similar to Pomodoro as it allows you to remove yourself as an obstacle. The idea is to just start doing whatever you're supposed to do, with the intention of only doing 1% of it. Or 5 minutes of it. Whatever makes sense to you.

However, once you've invested some time into the task, you'll find yourself thinking "Well I've already started, might as well carry on!" It's like you're manouvering your mind into a [sunk-cost fallacy](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/sunk-cost-fallacy/). Like it's a child you need to trick into paying attention.

And voila, you're being productive.

### 3. Procrastinaton

Yes, procrastination. As a productivity technqiue.

This one will probably make less sense, mostly because it's not an actual, peer-reviewed and road-tested technique and more something I pulled out my ass.

When we procrastinate, we usually do so by devoting our time to banal, useless activities like social media. Or watching CW superhero shows. Or trying to get our cats to beef. Just generally things that do not require any brain power at all. 

In our mind, we prioritize everything, whether we know it or not. Our subconscious is always acting as a file cabinet, sorting out what's important and what's irrelevant. You'll find that, in certain unfortunate times of your life when you ugh just have so much to do, these tasks will be stacked by importance and consequence. "I need to finish A, B, C and D. C needs to be done by tomorrow, so I'll do that first. But if I don't get started on B I'll fall behind and..." etc. 

You likely won't need any productity techniques when your ass is on the line. But what about when there's no deadline in sight and you need to get things done anyway?

A situation prone to a bout of procrastination, you say!

What I'd do is simply create a "stack" of things to do. All of these tasks will have varying levels of urgency, but prioritized in such a way that I'm able to get the things done that really need to be done.

Basically, you have a task at the top of the stack. Clean your car. You're feeling lazy, so what do you do? You procastinate, of course! Slly goose.


Only this time, you procrastinate by doing the next task on the stack. It stil feels like you're proctastinating, because you're putting off something that you were supposed to do, you naughty person you. Your mind will breathe a sigh of relief as you're avoiding doing the thing that you've been putting off for so long. Meanwhile, you're actually still being productive! Just don't let your brain know.

Not saying it's going to work (it probably won't) and I've only anecdotal evidence of it working for me. I'd only really recommend it if the other techniques are not working for you, or if you really need to force yourself into submission.

Now, time for some psycho-analysis!

So, why exactly do we procrastinate? Why do we consciously choose to make our lives harder for ourselves by constantly putting off things we're supposed to do? Even if those things will in the end only benefit us?

You'll notice that all the techniques I've listed involve some form of trickery or deceit. You're literally hacking your brain into being productive. But that begs the question, why is that not the default state? Why is this even necessary? It's your brain! It'll do what you tell it to do, dammit!

It's easy to just chalk it up to laziness, but that doesn't give us a significant answer. Why are we lazy, if that's the case?

The brain is truly an amazing creation, but it also unfortunately has to adhere to physics. Using your brain takes energy from your body. About [20%](https://www.brainfacts.org/brain-anatomy-and-function/anatomy/2019/how-much-energy-does-the-brain-use-020119), to be exact. A chess player can lose up to [6,000 calories](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/if-you-want-to-lose-weight-try-chess-grandmaster-diet-or-just-concentrate-really-really-hard-when-stakes-are-high.html) a day playing in a tournament.

So it's only natural that you'd want to conserve all that sweet, sweet energy.

My point is, being lazy is just... physics. It's natural. And fighting physics is as natural as rockets blasting off into space.

(Not a physicist. Also not 100% serious.)

I think the answer is that humans are just naturally resistant to change, whether that change is good or bad. 

Any change at all upends the status quo of our lives. People are creatures of habit, and we'll instinctively do everything in our power to keep our lives as conventional, as safe and as predictable as possible. We're hostile to any form of uncertainty. So even if that big change is something as positive as a new job or losing weight, it doesn't matter. Your mind doesn't differentiate between good change and bad change, all it knows is that it's going to have to stitch together a couple of neurons in order to facilitate that change. Energy, in other words.

I realize that I'm saying the word "change" a lot, but I believe our fear of it is
 at the core of some of the self-destructive behaviours we exhibit.

Something I did not realize until a few years ago is that I've always inhabited some form of a comfort zone, and I've always been afraid to leave the confines of that comfort zone, whatever form it took, be it my relationships or junk food. When I'm too happy, too settled, I get complacent and inevitably lose whatever drive I may have, which is obviously not conductive to any progress.

I'd lay awake in bed at night, thinking off all the things I was about to accomplish the next day. I'd feel excited and motivated to do these things, as they would lead me to the life I wanted to live. 

And then the next day would arrive and it'd go exactly as you'd expect. Community was added to Netflix, what was I supposed to do? NOT binge it?

The unfortunate reality
 is that motivation will always come and go. It's never a constant in life. It's just an emotion, and we should never use it as fuel for our desires. Let it guide you, not drive you.

There is unfortunately only one way to accomplish anything, and that is with discipline.

![Warren Buffet](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b5/a8/f9/b5a8f9e68d61f77b3ce0724530c85814.jpg)

So if you've made it this far, forget about all the technqiues you've just spent the last five minutes reading. Because I'm shit at blogging, apparently.

Instead, learn to discipline yourself. Use the mechanics of your brain to place yourself in a state of productivity, every single day. Develop a routine and stick to it.

It's said that it takes 21 days for a habit to form. Just three weeks. You'll fight with yourself endlessly in that three weeks, but you must remember that you're literally changing the configuration of your mind. 

But the reward is that you'll never have to fight dehabalitating amounts of procrastination ever again. At that point, procrastination will be as inconceivable to you as, well, procrastination. 

Good luck!
